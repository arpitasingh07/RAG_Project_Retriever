RRF then converted each rank into a reciprocal score using the formula 1 / (K + rank) where K=60, ensuring that higher-ranked results contribute more to the final score.

Each generated question is forced into a strict JSON structure and assigned one of four categories-factual, inferential, comparative, or multi-hop. To improve reliability, the system retries parsing multiple times and falls back to a handcrafted question template when the model fails to produce valid JSON.\n",

The final output is a balanced set of 100 diverse questions that reflect multiple reasoning styles and serve as a strong benchmark for evaluating our RAG system."

For each question, we checked the ground-truth Wikipedia URL and compared it against the top-k URLs returned by our retrieval function. We then looked at the position where the correct URL appeared: if it was 1st the score was 1, if 2nd the score was 1/2, if 3rd the score was 1/3, and if it did not appear, the score was 0. We repeated this for all questions and averaged the scores to get the final MRR. Along with the score, we recorded the retrieved URLs and their ranks for analysis. This gives us a simple and intuitive measure of how quickly and accurately the system retrieves the correct source document."

        "To assess how retrieval depth affects performance, we evaluated our system at three different top-k values (5, 10, and 20) and observed the impact on MRR for dense, BM25, and hybrid retrieval. The results show that increasing k slightly improves retrieval coverage particularly for BM25 while dense retrieval remains strong across all settings and the hybrid method consistently achieves the highest MRR. Based on this, k = 10 offers a good trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. For the generation stage, we selected N = 3 as the optimal number of reranked chunks to pass to the answer generator, providing sufficient context while avoiding noise. In the RRF fusion step, we used the standard smoothing constant K = 60, which is widely adopted in retrieval literature and ensures stable integration of lexical and semantic ranking signals. Overall, these design choices balance performance, stability, and efficiency across the pipeline."

        "Although the system achieves high retrieval scores (MRR@10 = 0.94, Recall@10 = 0.99), adversarial tests reveal cases where answers are grounded but factually incorrect. Retrieval metrics measure whether the model retrieves the same chunk from which the question was synthetically generated not whether that chunk semantically corresponds to the question meaning. Thus, the system remains faithful to the retrieved context but may still answer incorrectly if the retrieved context does not contain the factual answer. This demonstrates that high retrieval performance does not necessarily translate to factual correctness, especially in synthetic QA settings."

        "To study confidence calibration, we used the cross-encoder reranker's relevance score as a proxy for the system\u2019s confidence and compared it against answer correctness using a calibration curve. For each question, we recorded the highest rerank score from the retrieved chunks and paired it with a correctness label derived from our groundedness metric (1 = answer fully supported by retrieved context, 0 = ungrounded). The resulting calibration trend shows a strong positive correlation: high-confidence scores almost always correspond to grounded answers, while the very few incorrect responses appear only at lower confidence levels. This indicates that the system is well-calibrated, its confidence scores meaningfully reflect the likelihood that an answer is correct and contextually supported.\n"

These points also correspond to medium or high reranker confidence scores, indicating that the system is reliably confident when providing correct answers.\n",
        "\n",
        "Only a single point appears at correctness = 0, and its confidence score is notably lower than the rest. This pattern demonstrates a meaningful correlation: higher cross-encoder confidence strongly aligns with grounded, correct answers, while lower confidence is associated with the only observed error. Overall, the graph shows that the model is well-calibrated, with confidence scores that accurately reflect answer reliability."

The interface displays the generated answer, retrieval scores (dense, BM25, RRF, reranker), response time, and chunk-level context snippets, providing a transparent and interpretable breakdown for each query. This satisfies the interactive dashboard requirement by offering live metrics, retrieval explanation, and method comparisons in a single interface."

        "From the heatmap, BM25 shows a wide spread of darker cells, meaning it frequently ranks the correct URL lower or misses it completely. Dense retrieval performs significantly better, with lighter colors and fewer failures. The Hybrid retriever consistently achieves the best performance, with nearly all questions appearing in very light shades indicating Rank-1 retrieval for almost every case.\n",
